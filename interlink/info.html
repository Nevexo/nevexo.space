        <p>Project Interlink was originally created to solve a problem my <a href="https://willwilson.space">friend</a> and I had,</p>
        <p>whenever we wanted to work on/learn something, we'd have to open ports in firewalls or settle with screen share.</p>
        <p>Project Interlink was created to create a permanent, but isolated, lab network between each of our home networks.</p>
        <br>
        <p class='section-header'>Project Features</p>
        <p>Project Interlink uses the <a href="https://vyos.io">VyOS router</a> software stack, a fork of Vyatta.</p>
        <p>OSPF Announces the various routes each member has, see below.</p>
        <p><a href="https://wireguard.com">WireGuard</a> provides a constant, secure & quiet connection between the routers, as well as offering peering.</p>
        <p>SNMP Provides real-time monitoring for the network.</p>

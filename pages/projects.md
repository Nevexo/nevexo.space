I often write software for [tmw.media](https://tmw.media), some of these projects are from college & university
& the rest are just personal projects.

## tmw.media API <span class="label active">Active</span>
The tmw.media API is a closed-source (for now) node.js micro-service based API used primarily for our internet radio,
[GGRadio.net](https://ggradio.net). It interacts with [Icecast](https://www.icecast.org/) to pull now-playing information
and exposes to over a RESTful API, for example [/ggradio/aggregates](https://api.tmw.media/v4.1/ggradio/aggregates)

## Mixer Retweet (RetweetX) <span class="label retired">Retired</span>
~~RetweetX is a node.js based Twitter bot with a rule system. It's mainly used for 
[Mixer Retweet](https://twitter.com/mixerretweet), a Twitter account I co-own that's used for promoting people's
[Mixer](https://mixer.com) live streams. ~~

Mixer has decided to shutdown, thus, the Mixer Retweet project has been retired.
RetweetX will no longer be mainted, at least for the foreseeable future.

## Radio Show Text-in Platform <span class="label in-development">In Development</span>
During the [George Greenaway](https://www.facebook.com/TheGeorgeGreenawayShow/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel&eid=ARBpjaWC8sElfztJObZAB6F4hKmRHL9Y6J-coNtqXMPuXoBFhvCbbcC72MT0LimJqt5_9fsaVwZqAGiE) 24 & 48 hour shows I built
a text-in platform that allows fans of the show to send SMS, Tweets, Facebook messages etc into a central dashboard
that presenters can view.

For the upcoming 72 hour show I'm building a new, mini-micro-service platform in Node (and maybe Rust). 
This version is open source, and the in-development codebase can be viewed 
[at this GitHub repo](https://github.com/georgegreenawayshow/messaging).

## Local Business Networking & Surveillance <span class="label active">Active</span>
I built and still maintain a small network for a local business.

We use EdgeMAX for routing, HP/Aruba for switching, various CCTV-Camera vendors & Milestone XProtect for recording.

More information is available on request.

## Car-Game Assignment <span class="label retired">Retired</span> <span class="label college">College</span>
In 2020 I built a car-driving game for my BTEC work. A working version is available
 [here](https://car-game.nevexo.space).

And the souce is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/nevexo/u14-a2)

## 'Shootblocker' BTEC Assignment Work <span class="label retired">Retired</span> <span class="label college">College</span>
Over 2019-2020 my class & I designed a Phaser.js based game for our BTEC work. A working version
is available [here](https://shootblocker.nevexo.space)

This project mainly focused on using Git source control to manage work across multiple people. It's on GitHub
but private. It's not the kind of codebase I'd want on display.

## HBWS BTEC Assignment Work <span class="label retired">Retired</span> <span class="label college">College</span>
In 2019 we were tasked with designing a website for a fictional busiess as part of the Computing BTEC. 

The source is available on [my GitHub](https://github.com/Nevexo/Unit-15-Assignment-2) - there's nolonger a working
online version of this website. Probably for the better.

<p class="footer">I have many other, smaller, projects on my GitHub/Lab accounts.</p>

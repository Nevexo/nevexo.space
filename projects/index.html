            <h3>tmw.media API <span class="label active">Active</span></h3>
            <p>
                One of my biggest projects to-date has been the <a href='//api.tmw.media'>tmw.media API</a>, originally built for
                the <a href='//ggradio.net'>GGRadio.net Internet Radio</a><br>
                this API provides real-time music information, including titles, artists, artwork and play time.<br>
                The API has had 5 revisions, three of which I have written. The API is now written in Node.JS and uses <br>
                Docker for fast deployment and scaling.<br>
                Being modular, this API now services other projects from tmw.media, including <a href='//virtual-market.org'>Virtual Market.</a>

            <h3>Mixer Retweet / Retweet X <span class="label active">Active</span> </h3>
            <p>
                Mixer Retweet version 3.0, code-named 'RetweetX' is a Twitter auto-retweet bot originally built for a Twitter
                account I co-own, <a href='https://twitter.com/mixerRetweet'>Mixer Retweet</a>.<br>
                This bot is written in TypeScript, features a web interface and is highly modular.

            <h3>HeroPro <span class="label in-development">In Development</span> </h3>
            <p>
                HeroPro (name change pending) is a digital signage micro-service platform, written in TypeScript, C# and Python.<br>
                The original plan for HeroPro was a digital signage system that made use of Microsoft Windows' Screen saver system. <br>
                The project will expand on this to support many different viewing platforms, and use distributed micro-services to reduce
                network load.

            <h3>George Greenaway Show Management System <span class="label retired">Retired</span> </h3>
            <p>
                During the <a href='https://www.fb.com/TheGeorgeGreenawayShow'>George Greenaway</a> 24 and 36 hour radio marathons, I wrote a show Management
                system, collecting SMS, Facebook, Twitter and donation messages,<br>
                and placed them into a web interface, it also had a communication system for show crew, a note taking system and used WebSockets to deliver<br>
                new messages in near real-time.

            <h3>tmw.media API <span class="label active">Active</span></h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://api.tmw.media">tmw.media API</a> is a high-performance, RESTful IceCast 2 API. It offers information on: now playing,
                recently played, artwork and website telemetry.<br>
                While it's primary use-case is tmw.media's own websites such as <a href='https://ggradio.net'>GGRadio.net</a>, anybody can read the documentation,
                and use it for their own projects.<br>
                tmw.media API is written in <b>TypeScript</b> and uses <b>Docker containers</b> for management. For communication, a <b>RESTful Express API</b> and <b>WebSockets</b>
                are used.
                <br><br>
                <b>January 2020: </b> A new micro-service version of this API is currently in development. More info soon.

            <p>
                MixerRetweet (MXRRT, RTX) is an advanced Twitter auto-retweet bot used primarily by <a href="https://twitter.com/mixerRetweet">Mixer Retweet.</a><br>
                An open-source version of this project will be available soon, but for now it remains closed source until the API is fully developed, and the bugs
                are ironed out.

            <p>
                VM-Bot is another project I developed for <a href='https://tmw.media'>tmw.media</a> - it's a fairly simple <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> bot
                for <a href="https://virtual-market.org">Virtual Market</a> (a virtual goods trading forum)<br>
                It has moderation, rule searching, automatic role management, anti-spam features and welcome messages.<br>
                Once the codebase has been tidied up, I will make this project open source.

            <p>
                During the <a href='https://www.fb.com/TheGeorgeGreenawayShow'>George Greenaway</a> 24 and 36 hour radio marathons, I wrote a text-in system
                that collects SMS messages, Facebook messages and Tweets to<br>
                display them on a simple web interface. It was written in <b>Node.JS</b>, and used basic HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.<br>
                This project has been retired for the time being, it will remain in this state unless it's needed again in the future<br><br>
                <b>January 2020:</b> A new version of this platform is currently in development for the next Radio Marathon.<br>

            <h3>tmw.media API <span class="label active">Active</span></h3>
            <p>
                The <a href="https://api.tmw.media">tmw.media API</a> is a fast, RESTful JSON web API used by the internet radio, <a href="https://ggradio.net">GGRadio</a>
                It offers access to our <b>now playing</b>, <b>recently played</b> and<br> <b>currently displayed artwork</b> in a simple to use 
                JSON format. While primarily used by tmw.media's own websites, it can be used by anyone<br> and new features are being added all the time, such as
                a WebSocket, song-request feature and song-runtime information<br>
                It is written in <b>Node.JS</b> and uses Docker for containerization.

            <h3>Mixer Retweet / Retweet X <span class="label active">Active</span> </h3>
            <p>
                MixerRetweet (MXRRT, RTX) is an advanced Twitter auto-retweet bot used primarily by <a href="https://twitter.com/mixerRetweet">Mixer Retweet.</a><br>
                An open-source version of this project will be available soon, but now for it remains close-sourced until the API is fully developed, and the bugs
                are ironed out.

            <h3>Virtual Market Discord Bot <span class="label active">Active</span> </h3>
            <p>
                VM-Bot is another project I developed for <a href='https://tmw.media'>tmw.media</a> - it's a fairly simple <a href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a> bot
                for <a href="https://virtual-market.org">Virtual Market</a> (a virtual goods trading forum)<br>
                It has moderation, rule searching, automatic role management, anti-spam features and welcome messages.<br>
                Once the codebase has been tidied up, I will make this project open source.

            <p>
                'HeroPro' is an in-development digital signage system built in <b>TypeScript</b> and distributed using <b>Docker Containerization</b><br>
                It not only has basic web-based viewers, but also makes use of Windows' SCR files, to allow dormant computers<br>
                to be used for advertising/announcements.

            <h3>Show Text-In Platform <span class="label retired">Retired</span> </h3>
            <p>
                During the <a href='https://www.fb.com/TheGeorgeGreenawayShow'>George Greenaway</a> 24 and 36 hour radio marathons, I wrote a text-in system
                that collects SMS messages, Facebook messages and Tweets to<br>
                display them on a simple web interface. It was written in <b>Node.JS</b>, and used basic HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend.<br>
                This project has been retired for the time being, it will remain in this state unless it's needed again in the future<br>
                I have decided not to make this project open source, mostly because it was written in a hurry, so the code base isn't... perfect.

                HBWS (Hot Beans Web Services) was a fictional business created for a college assignment. It's legacy still exists<br>
                on <a href="https://college.nevexo.space">college.nevexo.space</a> - somewhat, regrettably.
